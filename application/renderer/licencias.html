Copyright (c) 2011, Matthew Desmond (http://www.madtype.com | mattdesmond@gmail.com),with Reserved Font Name Quantico.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
https://openfontlicense.org


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

DISCLAIMER
THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF

The Artistic License 2.0

Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given "Package" may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a Package. If the terms of this license do not permit you to use a Package as you wish, such arrangements are strongly recommended.

Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means you, if you are an individual, or the entity you represent, if you are a corporation or other organization.

"Source Form" means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.

"Standard Version" means the Source Form of the Package if made available to you by the Copyright Holder or by a Contributor acting on behalf of the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Source Form of the Package, or any portion thereof, that has been modified prior to distribution by you.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it available to others.

"Larger Work" means a work that combines the Package or a portion thereof with code or other material not governed by the terms of this license.

"Executable Form" means the compiled or interpreted form of the Package that is intended to be executed on a computer and includes everything required for execution of the Package.

"Aggregated Software" means a collection of modules for use with the Package.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source Form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and make other modifications that the Copyright Holder authorizes to the Standard Version.

A Modified Version of the Standard Version may be Distributed to others, provided that you meet the following requirements:

(a) You make available to others the Source Form of the Modified Version along with the Compiled form of the Modified Version at a cost equivalent to your distribution costs.

(b) You document the changes made to the Standard Version, and the date of those changes.

(c) You inform recipients that they may obtain the Standard Version of the Package from the Copyright Holder, and inform them of the location of the Standard Version.

(d) You do not use the name of the Copyright Holder or the name of any Contributor to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

Permissions for Redistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.

(c) permit anyone receiving a copy of your Modified Version to make the Source Form of your Modified Version available to others under

(i) the Original License or

(ii) a license that permits redistribution and modification of the Source Form of the Package, in addition to all the conditions of this license.

Permissions for Redistribution of Non-Source Versions of the Package

(5) You may Distribute a Compiled form of the Standard Version or Modified Version in any medium, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

(a) distribute the Compiled form with the Source Form of the same version;

(b) make the Source Form available in a location from which the Compiled form is distributed, and inform recipients of how to obtain it.

(c) Distribute the Compiled form without the Source Form at all, provided that you inform recipients of the location of the Source Form.

(6) You may Distribute the Executable Form of this Package in a Larger Work without restriction, provided that you satisfy the requirements of this license for that Package.

(7) You may Distribute the Executable Form of this Package as Aggregated Software.

(8) C or C++ subroutines compiled from Source Form of this Package may be linked to other code in order to produce an Executable Form of this Package.

(9) You may link C or C++ subroutines compiled from Source Form of this Package to code external to this Package to produce an Executable Form, provided that you insert a prominent notice in the code that states that the code has been linked with this Package.

Aggregation from Other Sources

(10) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or a Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.
